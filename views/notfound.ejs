                “We all lose friends… we lose them in death, to distance, and
                over time. But even though they may be lost, hope is not. The
                key is to keep them in your heart, and when the time is right,
                you can pick up the friendship right where you left off. Even
                the lost find their way home, when you leave the light on” – Amy
